## Projects
### NFC Platform for Interactions and Product Authentication
I designed brooches, necklaces, hats and other wearbles to carry NFCs and allow for different scanning experiences. The NFCs linked to a webapp that allowed for product purchase, the sharing of digital art associated with a brand, and product authentication. Recieved feedback from users and iterated. Raised money and sold product.

### Ollie and Marie - Noise-responsive Robot for the Young and Autistic
As part of a product design class, I created a classroom robot by outfitting a plushie octopus with LEDS and my smartphone. As part of this project I made an Android App to measure noise levels and  algorythmically display expressive faces to provide children with feedback about classroom noise levels.

### Personal Tools
Built Think-Tool and Regression-Tool which help me think and analyze data. Think Tool uses AI to create a worksheet that allows me to clarify and improve my thinking, it generates probing questions, and it suggests reading material for research. Regression tool allows me to visualize data sets, compare them, find statistical measures, and preform regression. I plan to expand these personal tools over time as I learn more about problem solving and data analysis.
